This is for the Linux file folder display utility, bt

There is only one C source file for this project, bt.c.  It compiles with a gcc compiler.

How to run bt, a file directory display utility.
    
    bt [-h] [-L -d -g -i -p -s -t -u | -l] [dirname]\n\n"
    
    -h for help
    -L to follow symbolic links.
    -d to show the time of the last modificaton.
    -g to print the GID associated with the file.
    -i to print number of links to file in inode table.
    -p to print permissions.
    -s to print the file size.
    -t to print file type information.
    -u to print the UID associated with the file.
    -l is equivalent to the options tpiugs.


I had fun doing this project, i had difficulties at first because it wouldnt compile on my gcc until i connected to delmar/hoare and 
made sure it worked there. All the commands print out proper messages and work perfectly fine. However, a potential issue.
While it does follow symbolic links, it might have a problem with cyclical symbolic links.
